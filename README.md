# dotfiles

Personal configuration files managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Each package is a directory that mirrors the `$HOME` structure — stow creates symlinks so editing files in this repo is the same as editing them directly.

## Packages

| Package | Symlinked to |
|---------|-------------|
| `nvim` | `~/.config/nvim/` (LazyVim) |
| `tmux` | `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` |
| `zsh` | `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zsh_aliases`, `~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml` |
| `starship` | `~/.config/starship.toml` |
| `ghostty` | `~/.config/ghostty/config` |
| `bat` | `~/.config/bat/config` |
| `lazygit` | `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml` |
| `lazydocker` | `~/.config/lazydocker/config.yml` |
| `gh` | `~/.config/gh/config.yml` |
| `git` | `~/.gitconfig` |
| `mise` | `~/.config/mise/config.toml` |
| `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |

## Setup

Clone the repo, then bootstrap and install:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
make bootstrap
make install
```

## Commands

### `make bootstrap`
Installs all dependencies (sheldon, starship, bat, zoxide, fzf, lazygit, gh, git-delta, mise). Safe to run on a fresh machine — skips anything already installed.

### `make install`
Stows all packages by creating symlinks from `$HOME` into this repo. Run once after cloning. Aborts on conflicts — if a config file already exists at the target path, remove it first and re-run.

### `make sync`
Restows all packages. Run this after pulling updates or adding new files to a package — it tears down and recreates all symlinks to pick up any changes in the repo structure.

## Machine-specific config

Copy `.zshrc.local.example` to `~/.zshrc.local` for overrides that shouldn't be tracked (work proxies, GPU workarounds, extra PATH entries). This file is gitignored.

## Adding a new package

1. Create a directory named after the package (e.g. `foo/`)
2. Mirror the target path inside it (e.g. `foo/.config/foo/config`)
3. Add `stow_package foo` to `scripts/install.sh`
4. Add `foo` to the list in `scripts/sync.sh`
5. Run `make sync`
